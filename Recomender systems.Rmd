Scenario Design is an easy-to-use "three question framework" that helps you in making sure that the information in your analysis work takes UX (user experience) into account:

- Who are the target users?
- What are the key goals?
- How can you help them accomplish those goals?

Credit Karma, a San Franciscoâ€“based company founded in 2007. Credit Karma offers free ongoing access to credit scores and credit reports provided by TransUnion and Equifax. 

 

###Who are the target users?

Target users are customers looking to find out their credit score, and receive free recommendations about bettering their credit background, based off their current credit profile.
 
###What are the key goals?

They want to make sure that they know their credit score, in addition to finding out what they could do with their current credit. Like find the best credit card or loan offer. In addition, customers use credit karma to find out their likeliness of approval for variety of financial products. 

###How can you help them accomplish those goals?

 
Credit Karma is unique, because they offer multiple solutions, which they designed to the tree credit categories of customers. "Excellent Credit, Average Credit, and Rebuilding/Building Credit". For example, a customer with excellent credit may be looking for a credit card with perks, and Credit Karma will match them with the best-suited cards, based off their credit score. A customer with Average credit, may be looking to take out a personal loan, in order to consolidate their debt, and raise their credit score, and Credit Karma will recommend this offer to you, because they may see large balances, and find the right solutions for you. And lastly, Credit Karma will also match the right solutions for a customer with bad credit, or someone looking to rebuild their credit, by seeing their credit history, and their credit trends.

 
I would recommend the company, to send voluntary questioner on a quarterly basis, where Credit Karma users can provide information about their current expectations, goals, and plans for the future. By doing so, Credit Karma can offer more customized solutions, which aren't just based off the customers credit score, but also solutions based off the customers life events that they may be expecting. Since Credit Karma offers these solutions, they can more directly connect customers to the right financial path, in order to have the least impact to the customers credit score.
